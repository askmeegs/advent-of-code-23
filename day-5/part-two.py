each map in all maps is a map we need to process to slice and dice our seed pair intervals to the correct value intervals.
each sub list in map is one mapping. each mapping is [(source_start, source_end), (dest_start, dest_end)] 
if the seed pair interval doesn't fall into the mapping interval, ignore. keep val as is. 

if any part of the seed pair interval falls into the mapping interval, we need to slice and dice the seed pair subinterval to the dest subinterval -- but keep the rest of the seed pair range that DOESN'T overlap intact (map the values to whatever the value range would be.)
